# C++ Essentials

Welcome to the **C++ Essentials** repository! This repository contains a collection of basic C++ programs designed to help beginners learn and practice fundamental C++ programming concepts.

## Programs Included

1. **Even/Odd Checker**
   - **File:** `Even.cpp`
   - **Description:** This program takes an integer input from the user and determines whether the number is even or odd using a `switch` statement.

2. **Prime Number Checker**
   - **File:** `Prime.cpp`
   - **Description:** This program checks if a given number is prime or not. It divides the number by all integers less than its half to determine its primality.

3. **Number Table Generator**
   - **File:** `array.cpp`
   - **Description:** This program generates and displays a table of the input number with its square and cube values, iterating from the input number up to 9.

4. **Simple Calculator**
   - **File:** `basiccalculator.cpp`
   - **Description:** This program functions as a simple calculator, performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input.

5. **Month Days Identifier**
   - **File:** `month.cpp`
   - **Description:** This program takes a month number as input and displays the corresponding month name along with the number of days in that month.

6. **Palindrome Checker**
   - Checks whether a given number is a palindrome.
   - **File:** `Palindrome.cpp`

7. **Shape Type Identifier**
   - Determines if the given coordinates form a square, rectangle, or parallelogram.
   - **File:** `cardinals.cpp`

8. **Ceiling Value Calculator**
   - Computes the ceiling value of a given floating-point number.
   - **File:** `ceiling_num.cpp`

9. **Floor Value Calculator**
   - Computes the floor value of a given floating-point number.
   - **File:** `floor_num.cpp`

10. **Max-Min Comparator**
   - Compares two numbers and determines which is maximum and minimum, with the ability to count the number of comparisons.
   - **File:** `numbers.cpp`

11. **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**
   - Implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game for two players.
   - **File:** `rockpaper.cpp`
